    heading: "Teaching & learning code is hard"

      ### Issues when teaching code…

      1. Demoing code in class isn’t enough
      2. People follow at different speeds in class
      3. People *holding up hands* & waiting for help
      4. People needing extra support & constant feedback
      5. Lots of practice necessary: meaning lots of grading
      6. People not wanting to learn code

      ### Solutions I’ve come up with…

      1. Rely on videos, with small (< 10 min) lecture
      2. With videos, they can re-watch, take their time
      3. Sticky notes! Coloured sticky note question triage
      4. Markbot! Instant feedback, support, guidance
      5. Markbot! Completely automated grading
      6. *Still working on that one…*
